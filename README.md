# Interactive Musical Storytelling

An interactive web-based musical composition tool that allows users to create dynamic narratives through sound. This project explores the intersection of storytelling and music, where different musical elements represent various aspects of a story.

## Overview

The application presents two main story elements:
- **Events**: Dramatic moments represented by rhythmic patterns (Remorse, Vengeance, Massacre, Felina)
- **People**: Characters in the story represented by chord progressions (Boy, Uncle, Mother, Sister)

## How It Works

### Interactive Composition
- Users can click on different blocks to compose their story in real-time
- All blocks are synchronized to a 4-bar grid, ensuring musical coherence
- The orange blinking effect indicates when a block is scheduled to play
- Only one Event and one People block can play at a time

### Story Elements

#### Events
- **Remorse**: A contemplative rhythm pattern
- **Vengeance**: An intense, driving beat
- **Massacre**: A chaotic, powerful rhythm
- **Felina**: A dramatic, climactic pattern

#### People
- **Boy**: The protagonist's theme
- **Uncle**: A mysterious chord progression
- **Mother**: A nurturing, warm harmony
- **Sister**: A gentle, supportive melody

### Volume Controls
- **Event**: Control the intensity of the story's events
- **People**: Adjust the presence of characters in the narrative

## Technical Features
- Synchronized playback using Tone.js
- Real-time scheduling with visual feedback
- Smooth transitions between different story elements
- BPM-synchronized visual indicators
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Usage
1. Click any Event or People block to begin your story
2. The first click establishes the timing grid
3. Subsequent clicks will schedule changes at the next 4-bar boundary
4. Use the volume sliders to balance the narrative elements
5. Create different combinations to tell different stories

## About
This project explores how musical elements can be used as storytelling devices, allowing users to create their own narratives through the interaction of different musical patterns. Each combination of Event and People creates a unique emotional landscape, giving users the freedom to express different story arcs through music.
